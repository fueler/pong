1. I'm using uv to manage my python project. Create a pong game using pygame. Use uv to add dependencies. The opponent shold be AI and have a 10% chance to miss the ball. The winner is the player with 10 points. The actual player should move the pong up and down using arrow keys. There should be a splash screen for 5 seconds showing "An Adam Production" followed by a title screen showing "Pong" and "Start" in smaller font waiting for the player to press the spacebar to start the game. Once the game is over display a message stating who won and waiting on the spacebar to be pressed.

2. 1. Add an "Exit" option to the title screen to quit the game. Let the player use arrow keys to select "Start" or "Exit". 
   2. After showing the winner go back to the title screen, not the splash screen.
   3. The AI should only miss 5% of the time.

3. 1. Add to the title screen a "Settings" option. Within the "Settings" screen allow the user to select how many points needed to win, difficulty of the AI.
   2. Settings should be permanently stored in a python config file and read when the game starts and saved when the user changes them.
   3. Add sound when the ball hits a pong paddle.
   4. Every time the ball hits a pong paddle it should move 1% faster

4. I don't have paddle.wav. Please add just a beep or something simple.

5. 1. When the ball is missed play a different simple beep three times.
   2. When the ball hits a paddle increase the ball speed by 5% instead of 1%.

6. 1. Add an exteme difficulty for the AI where it is very difficult to win against.
   2. For the title and settings screen allow for mouse input.

7. Store all the previous prompts in the order that I gave them in a prompts.txt file.
