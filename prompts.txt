1. I'm using uv to manage my python project. Create a pong game using pygame. Use uv to add dependencies. The opponent shold be AI and have a 10% chance to miss the ball. The winner is the player with 10 points. The actual player should move the pong up and down using arrow keys. There should be a splash screen for 5 seconds showing "An Adam Production" followed by a title screen showing "Pong" and "Start" in smaller font waiting for the player to press the spacebar to start the game. Once the game is over display a message stating who won and waiting on the spacebar to be pressed.

2. 1. Add an "Exit" option to the title screen to quit the game. Let the player use arrow keys to select "Start" or "Exit". 
   2. After showing the winner go back to the title screen, not the splash screen.
   3. The AI should only miss 5% of the time.

3. 1. Add to the title screen a "Settings" option. Within the "Settings" screen allow the user to select how many points needed to win, difficulty of the AI.
   2. Settings should be permanently stored in a python config file and read when the game starts and saved when the user changes them.
   3. Add sound when the ball hits a pong paddle.
   4. Every time the ball hits a pong paddle it should move 1% faster

4. I don't have paddle.wav. Please add just a beep or something simple.

5. 1. When the ball is missed play a different simple beep three times.
   2. When the ball hits a paddle increase the ball speed by 5% instead of 1%.

6. 1. Add an exteme difficulty for the AI where it is very difficult to win against.
   2. For the title and settings screen allow for mouse input.

7. Store all the previous prompts in the order that I gave them in a prompts.txt file.

8. 1. Add the ability to hit spacebar during a match to fire a missle straight across. If it hits the other player, play a different sound and stun time for 0.5s.
   2. Give a countdown, 3, 2, 1, at the start of the match before spawning the ball.

9. 1. The missle from the player should have a cooldown of 1.5s
   2. The AI can shoot missles as well, but theirs are blue.

10. 1. Allow for W to be used for up also.
    2. Allow for S to be used for down also.
    3. Spawn a star, that when shot with a missle it freezes the other player for 0.5s
    4. Player celebration sound that is generated like the others when the game is over
    5. Player a start sound that is generated like the others when the game starts, playing a beep which each countdown.

11. 1. Once the win situation occurs the countdown should not occur.
    2. The ball spawn should occur 1s after Go is shown.

12. 1. There needs to be a countdown for every ball that is spawned.
    2. Instead of diamond, a star would be better.
    3. In the menus, W and S should be able to move the selection

13. 1. The 1s after Go should be done after showing the playing field, not while Go is shown.
    2. Alternate the yellow star with a blue star. The blue star will make the player's paddle taller for 5s.
    3. In addition to the yellow and blue stars, add another star, a green star, that lets you move 25% faster for 5s.

14. Update prompts.txt with all the user prompts using the existing format.
